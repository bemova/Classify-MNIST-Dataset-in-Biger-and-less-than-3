WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/arz/Desktop/twitter/tensorflow-sample/ml_test_solution.py:224: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.
